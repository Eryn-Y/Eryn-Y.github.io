title: "Prospects for Improving Password Selection"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'In this work, we investigate whether prospect theory, a behavioral model of how people evaluate risk, can provide insights into how users choose passwords and whether it can motivate new designs for password selection mechanisms that will nudge users to select stronger passwords. The results provide guidance for designing and implementing password selection interfaces that will significantly improve the strength of user-chosen passwords.'
