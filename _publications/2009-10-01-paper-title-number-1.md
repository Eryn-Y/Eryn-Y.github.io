title: "Sensitivity Analysis for Dynamic Control of PSTNs with Skewed Distributions"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'Probabilistic Simple Temporal Networks (PSTN) facilitate solving many interesting scheduling problems by characterizing uncertain task durations with unbounded probabilistic distributions. However, most current approaches assess PSTN performance using normal or uniform distributions of temporal uncertainty. This paper explores how well such approaches extend to families of non-symmetric distributions shown to better represent the temporal uncertainty introduced by, e.g., human teammates by building new PSTN benchmarks.'
