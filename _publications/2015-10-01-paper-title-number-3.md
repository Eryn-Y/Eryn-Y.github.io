title: "Prospective consent: The effect of framing on cookie consent decisions"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'Prospect theory is a behavioral model of how people make decisions in the presence of risk; this work explores the application of prospect theory, particularly the reference-dependence effect, to user interactions with cookie banners. We find that for both possible slants, a negative framing is significantly more effective at nudging user decisions. We also find that the combination of slant and framing impact cookie opt-out rates by a factor of three.'
