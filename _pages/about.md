I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Software and Societal Systems Department in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I’m a current member of [VariAbility Lab](https://cmu-variability.github.io), advised by [Prof. Andrew Begel](https://andrewbegel.com). 

**My current research focuses on creating personalized, adaptable accessible systems for people with disabilities and the neurodivergent.** I completed my undergraduate degree at Pomona College. My cognitive science senior thesis explored how the length of virtual reality instruction impacts older adults' learning. In my computer science senior project, I developed a customizable music visualizaiton prototype for d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing people. My main past research experiences include prospect theory and privacy decisions, shared gaze and remote collaborative drawing, and the scheduling problem in human robot collaboration. 

In my free time, I enjoy travelling and performing in theater. I’m always up for swapping stories, so if you’re around Pittsburgh, let’s grab a coffee!
